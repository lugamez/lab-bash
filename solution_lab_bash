12. sed command is used to replace the text in a file. Use the sed command to replace all occurances of et with ET in the file at.txt file present in the folder lorem. You can use the following link to refer to sed commands [https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/manipulate-text-from-the-command-line-with-sed/] Check the contents of the sed.txt file using cat command.

--- There was only a word with "Et" (all the changes were already made in the file - I even checked this with Sandra. That's why I added "Et" instead of "et" in the command). Also, I checked the content of the modified file (at.txt) instead of sed.txt.
